# Face Recognition Using CNN

CNN - Convolution Neural Network

- Face Detection

We had used Haar Cascade for face detection. Haar Cascade is a feature-based object detection algorithm to detect objects from images. A cascade function is trained on lots of positive and 
negative images for detection. The algorithm does not require extensive computation and can run in real-time.

- Face Recognition

Face recognition component of the project used a deep learning approach based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow. The CNN was trained on a self-prepared dataset and was able to recognize faces in new images by comparing extracted features to those learned during training.

Advantages:
- Less Time To Train Model.
- High Accuracy.
- Efficient Face Recognition on Limited Hardware Architecture
